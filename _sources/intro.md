# Behind the Scenes of my Learning Journey

This book is an effort for me to document my journey
as I learn different technologies and share both the
key ideas I found and the mistakes I made - so you
don't have to.

## 1. Jupyter Books explored

I came across a tutorial on Sphinx
(hosted by Data Umbrella) - which is part of the
foundation for Jupyter Books, but it honestly appeared
quite intimidating to me.

When I came across Khuyen Tran's brilliant LinkedIn
post where she shared her Jupyter Book, a light bulb
instantly went off for me, so much so that I was
inspired to ask her for a connection, which she
graciously accepted. Her post gave me just enough of a nudge
to try it out... and here we are! This site is my first
attempt at Jupyter Books after getting cosy with
Jupyter Notebooks.

In this section, I literally take you through how I
learned to set it up. This include the challenges I
faced (especially in adjusting the front-end to match
my brand) and some mistakes I made working on it in a
Windows environment (such as my difficulty setting up
an older Python version in my virtual environment on
Windows).

## 2. The NLP toolbox

This was created during my time as a 2021 Delta
Analytics Fellow. This framework really enabled me
to structure my NLP problem in an optimal way,
leading to my first YouTube lecture.

BONUS! You get to also learn from my struggles in model
selection and optimization, working with JSON and
translating data between Python and R environments.

## 3. Graph Databases Relearned

I got to interact with graph technology for the
first time in a team at Bootcamp 33 and it was
pretty awesome.
In this section I aim to share strategies that helped
me understand this concept the first time round and
share my journey in recreating:

* how to curate data for a graph
* how to set up the schema for a graph (logic behind connections and visualization of the schema)
* how to write and run queries for a graph

I aim to share both platform-specific and
platform-agnostic solutions around graphs.
