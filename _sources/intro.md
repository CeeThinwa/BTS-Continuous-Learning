# Behind the Scenes of my Learning Journey

This book is an effort for me to document my journey
as I learn different technologies and share both the
key ideas I found and the mistakes I made - so you
don't have to.

## 1. The NLP toolbox

This was created during my time as a 2021 Delta
Analytics Fellow. This framework really enabled me
to structure my NLP problem in an optimal way,
leading to my first YouTube lecture.

## 2. Graph Databases Relearned

I got to interact with graph technology for the
first time in a team at Bootcamp 33 and it was
pretty awesome.
In this section I aim to share strategies that helped
me understand this concept the first time round and
share my journey in recreating:

* how to curate data for a graph
* how to set up the schema for a graph (logic behind connections and visualization of the schema)
* how to write and run queries for a graph
