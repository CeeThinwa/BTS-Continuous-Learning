# Behind the Scenes of my Learning Journey <br> 🤔💡

This book is an effort for me to document my journey
as I learn different technologies and share both the
key ideas I found and the mistakes I made - so you
don't have to.

This book contains the following sections:

## 1. [Functional Pandas in Python workflow 🐼🐍](pandas-python)

I have been using Pandas and Numpy (the Python libraries) since late 2018, but it is only
now that I have to functionize my operations. In this section, I share what I have learned
behind the scenes.

## 2. [Jupyter Books explored 📙](jupyter-book)

Jupyter Book is a flexible tool built on top of Sphinx to
* tell data stories, and/or
* share code that can allow the reader to replicate experiments, and/or
* discuss scientific research

In this section, I literally take you through how I
learned to set this Jupyter Book up - it is my first time working
with documentation tech in general ☺️

## 3. [Natural Language Processing explored 🔠📢🈺](NLP)

My journey in this space began from a need to identify in-demand
skills of marketing researchers, because I wanted to create
research that impacts not only marketing operations in a business
(marketing was my first qualification) but also leverages tech
to ease those operations. That project helped me mine and handle text
data and set the stage for my NLP project as a 2021 Delta Analytics
fellow.

Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP) in
particular, is affecting our daily lives more and more, as
advances in tech are made over time. In this section, I discuss my journey
learning NLP.

## 4. Streamlit rediscovered 🧑🏾‍💻

I first came across Streamlit in a Data Umbrella webinar,
and it really piqued my interest. Fast-forward to my
fellowship a couple of months later, I got the
opportunity this time to learn it in a coding lab
organised by a Delta Analytics facilitator, Brian Spiering.

It was not only enjoyable, but also forced me to get
my hands dirty with it (cue an Aha! moment that I
learn best in a project-based doing style compared to
a webinar listening style).

This came in handy when I got the opportunity to use
it as a localised proof of concept screen-shared demo.
It really made the demo come alive, and I got to
receive great suggestions around my modelling approach
like considering a reinforcement learning based approach
and optimizing my code for speed.

So in this section, I aim to share what I learned
and learn additional information. A key goal I have around
Streamlit is learning how to customize the front-end
and see if I can incorporate transformers.


## 5. Graph Databases Relearned 🕸️🗄️

I got to interact with graph technology for the
first time in a team at Bootcamp 33, and it was
pretty awesome.
In this section I aim to share strategies that helped
me understand this concept the first time round and
share my journey in recreating:

* how to curate data for a graph
* how to set up the schema for a graph (logic behind connections and visualization of the schema)
* how to write and run queries for a graph

I aim to share both platform-specific and
platform-agnostic solutions around graphs.

## 6. [Developing in the cloud ☁️🖥️💻📱](cloud)

One of the things that I learned in my internship
experience at Adrian Ltd. was that machine learning
needs a home that has a nice and clean frontend -
Jupyter notebooks were not appreciated as much by
people who were not from the AI/ML community. A
popular solution to deploy models involved using
Flask. A colleague at the time mentioned Django as
it was more robust and secure.

When pursuing my studies and facing a slowing life
as a result of the pandemic, I saw building a
website for the first time as a way to keep busy,
learn web development and deployment and share my
Masters journey.

Here I share the challenges I faced
(especially interacting with Linux for the first time
and setting up an SSL certificate) and the lessons
I learned along the way.

## 7. The Kiva project

In early 2019, I volunteered to mentor in a local initiative to
motivate Kenyans to master Data Science called Master
Cohorts. I decided to attempt the first assignment,
which was based on a past Kaggle competition aiming
to solve a problem for Kiva.

One of the highlights around working on this project
was that I really stretched my Pandas skills and also
got to marry two completely different datasets to
create the final notebook.
