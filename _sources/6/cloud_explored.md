# Cloud explored

One of the most important qualities of a skilled data scientist is
to understand the foundational way that data infrastructure works.
At the heart of cloud infrastructure is Linux OS supported by one or more CPUs /GPUs
and one or more storage disks.

In this section, I will take you through how:
1. [I set up my virtual private server as simply yet securely as possible](VM-setup)
2. I manage users and credentials securely
3. [I set up the ElasticSearch database](db-setup)
4. [I build an API to programmatically fetch data from different sources in sequence](api-setup)
5. I connect to an out-of-the-box ML
6. I track and preserve data lineage and provenance records
