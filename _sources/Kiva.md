# Behind the Scenes of the Kiva Project

I had volunteered to mentor in a local initiative to
motivate Kenyans to master Data Science called Master
Cohorts. I decided to attempt the first assignment,
which was based on a past Kaggle competition aiming
to solve a problem for KIVA.

One of the highlights around working on this project
was that I really stretched my Pandas skills and also
got to marry two completely different datasets to
create the final notebook.
