# Behind the Scenes of the Kiva Project

I had volunteered to mentor in a local initiative to
motivate Kenyans to master Data Science called Master
Cohorts. I decided to attempt the first assignment,
which was based on a past Kaggle competition aiming
to solve a problem for KIVA.

One of the highlights around working on this project
was that I really stretched my Pandas skills and also
got to marry two completely different datasets to
create the final notebook.

## About the Kiva Project

In this project, I sought to estimate the welfare level
of KIVA borrowers. The objective was to pair Kiva's 
2014-2018 data with additional data sources to estimate 
welfare level in specific regions, based on shared economic 
and demographic characteristics.

### Research Conclusions

***The impact of KIVA donors***

1. *93.3% of loans were financed by KIVA, with USD 225 being the most common amount*
2. *The most valuable partnerships are those with social impact businesses, which implies that they are able to handle regular payments as they make an income from their goods and services*
3. *Kenya and the Phillipines have a lot of funding for small loans*

***Welfare of KIVA borrowers***

*The welfare of borrowers that received the largest amount of funding on Kiva can be viewed as good because:*

* *Women form the bulk of the borrowers and they receive the highest number of funds, even as they have the highest shortfall*
* *Countries like Peru and El Salvador which based on the data have low MPI scores have received a lot of funding*
* *Few borrowers are taking loans for personal use*
* *Massive impact is being achieved for Kenyan men and Filipino women, because the loans are small enough to pay back and monthly repayments are taking up only 50% or less of their monthly income*

*With that said, it is concerning to see that countries that have many more people in need are not accessing large amounts of funds; furthermore, even when they do, places like Burkina Faso, Sierra Leone and Mali had a high debt burden, trapping borrowers from these countries in poverty.*
