# Customizing the Front End ðŸŒ¼

A brand identity is very important because it makes
your communications look and feel consistent across
all digital and offline channels. It allows people
to know that a particular person made any given piece
of content.

The next logical step after creating a newly minted
notebook is to customize it and make it yours.

How?

## 1. Through *css*

Through `css` of course! Jupyter Book allows for
tweaking css though a `custom.css` file created in the
`_static` folder. The `_static` folder sits in the main
repository alongside the `_build` folder.

It took quite a lot of work because I had to use the *Web
Developer* tools that can be found in most browsers and look
for the relevant elements and classes that I could modify.

My brand identity for the education portion of 
<a href='https://ceethinwa.github.io/education.html'>my website
</a> can be summarized as follows:

| Brand attribute      | Value     |
|----------------------|-----------|
| Font                 | Quicksand |
| Colour 1 - lavender  | #cbcce7   |
| Colour 2 - dark blue | #1f274c   |
| Colour 3 - cream     | #fffbf2   |

Once the codes are in place, the next step is to access the css
code that can be copied for modification purposes.

For instance, if I wanted to change the background for the
navigation panel that also shows the table of contents, I would
first access the *Web Developer* tools (I prefer Firefox)
by navigating first to the right-hand menu, naviagting to `More
Tools`, then navigating to `Web Developer Tools` resulting in:

![web1](../_static/images/img9.png)

To inspect the css code influencing the color of the navigation
bar, I click the code inside the inspector; this highlights
the html code a solid blue and colours the corresponding area of the web
page a more transparent blue like so:

![web2](../_static/images/img10.png)

Based on the visual, the `div` representing it has a 
`#site-navigation` id, with the current color. So to change it
to white (hex code #fff), I would create the following code in
`custom.css`:

```
#site-navigation {background-color: #fff;}
```

With enough time and patience, I was able to customize it into
the book you are now browsing.

## Through *emojis*!

You can also use emojis in your markdown by
* referencing the relevant decimal/hexadecimal code (a list can be found <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_emoji.asp'> here</a>), or
  * In this case, *How cool is `&#10024;` + `&#x2728;`* becomes *How cool is &#10024; + &#x2728;* 
* directly pasting it into the markdown before running the `build` command.
  * In this case, we directly get *How cool is that âœ¨!*
