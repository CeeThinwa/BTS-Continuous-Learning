# Jupyter Books explored

When I came across Khuyen Tran's brilliant LinkedIn
post where she shared her Jupyter Book, a light bulb
instantly went off for me! Her post gave me just enough of a nudge
to try it out... and here we are! This site is my first
attempt at Jupyter Books after getting years of
getting cosy with Jupyter Notebooks.

I will take you through:
1. My experience with initial setup of the book
2. How I altered the front-end of the book
3. My maintenance routine

This will include the challenges I
faced (especially in adjusting the front-end to match
my brand), as well as some mistakes I made working on it in a
Windows environment (such as my difficulty setting up
an older Python version in my virtual environment on
Windows)
