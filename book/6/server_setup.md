# Server Setup Notes

My first task was to identify a suitable server in terms of compute and storage space that worked for the project that I had in mind
* For my first project, a tiny server was enough
* For an ElasticSearch database, I worked with (as per this [recommendation](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-elasticsearch-on-ubuntu-20-04)) a slightly larger Ubuntu 22.10 server with 4GB RAM, 2 CPUs and regular disk type
