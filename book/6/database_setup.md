# Database Setup Notes

## NoSQL Database

The database of choice that I decided to adopt in this category was *ElasticSearch*.

Based on [the page where one could get started](https://www.elastic.co/webinars/getting-started-elasticsearch?baymax=default&elektra=docs&storm=top-video),
I went to their [download page](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch).

I decided to first set it up locally on my Windows.
