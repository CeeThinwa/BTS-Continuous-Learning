# Customizing the Front End

A brand identity is very important because it makes
your communications look and feel consistent across
all digital and offline channels. It allows people
to know that a particular person made any given piece
of content.

The next logical step after creating a newly minted
notebook is to customize it and make it yours.

How?

Through `css` of course! Jupyter Book allows for
tweaking css though a `custom.css` file created in the
`_static` folder, making the path to access it like so:

```
\directory\_static\custom.css
```
